## How to Get Involved?

If it makes the site better and doesn't break anything, please send a Pull Request. My philosophy is: merge first, improve the code later.

Get a few Pull Requests merged and I'll give you access to merge PRs from other contributors.

Other ways to contribute:
- Write documentation
- Write tests
- Report bugs
- Propose features and improvements

## Setup

I'll add setup instructions when I will have time. If you're familiar with Symfony, then that should be easy (you can also add instructions).
