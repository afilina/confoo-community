It swept the Ops world by storm in 2014, became mainstream in 2015, and now it&rsquo;s set to dominate the developer world, in 2016.<br><br>Docker is a tool that allows you to package your application up into a single-runnable distributable binary - akin to the phar, but in Hulk mode. Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production.<br><br>In this talk I will cover the creation of this utopian distributable and show you how to compose your entire production infrastructure locally with only a small YAML file and without installing a single thing.<br><br>Lets say hello, to Docker.<br><a href="http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3755">More details at http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3755</a><br><p style="font-style:italic;font-size:80%">Powered by <a href="http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3755">Open Tech Calendar</a><br>Sponsored by <a href="http://www.amazondc.com/">Amazon Development Centre Scotland</a></p>]]></content><updated>2016-03-08T10:26:31Z</updated><author><name>Open Tech Calendar</name></author></entry>

It will allow you to make framework based decisions on a per-feature basis instead of a per-application basis.<br><br>In this talk Paul Dragoonis am going to demonstrate a framework delivery engine that lets you be in charge. Additionally, he will show how you can modernise/refactor legacy systems or CMS&rsquo;s (i.e: Wordpress) by utilising your PPI app as a service container within them.<br><a href="http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3666">More details at http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3666</a><br><p style="font-style:italic;font-size:80%">Powered by <a href="http://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3666">Open Tech Calendar</a><br>Sponsored by <a href="http://www.amazondc.com/">Amazon Development Centre Scotland</a></p>]]></content><updated>2016-02-04T22:21:18Z</updated><author><name>Open Tech Calendar</name></author></entry>

Yet far too often we, as engineers, focus on providing a solution to the problem at hand and overlook the problems that the solution itself might cause.
